The Mars colony was vast, a valley of geodesic domes and sleek robotics crisscrossing across the red savannah. I stared out the window of my shuttle in awe at what I was seeing. A fellow colonist tapped me on the shoulder to get my attention: ‘Just like the VR tour, eh?,’ but it wasn’t like the VR tour, that had been close up and on the ground, dizzying and maze-like. Up here from a birds eye view the whole thing was revealed in its sheer scale, astonishing in its breadth.

They called it Megascale because that was what it felt like to be ‘on the ground.’ Umbrella domes, starkly aerated ‘urban’ settlements, Biosphere quarters and dome farms were all visible, dotting the ‘domains’ of land and sky so aptly named Americas, Oceania and Africa. A settlement I’d identified as I’d been granted an ‘domain citizenship’ was classified as what I’d been told was a ‘nomad’ domain. The citizens lived in islands of Megascale, crafted and maintained within a series of spheric Maglev tubes that snaked in and out of the way I could see from my domed window even now. It wasn’t settlement by population. A host of robots populated these Bifurcated ‘nomad’ domes.

My ‘domain citizenship’ was for a 48 hour term of 1000 credits, on the Northern continent, one of the colony’s largest settlements, because I’d ordered the VR tour and ‘visited’ Relativity Ruled. The new interconnected world I’d now be overseeing, roots-free but like-networked like VR experience it was America’s promise. Over 200,000,000 of us were here, thriving, or in the case of the biological clock-oriented, forming individual units, or ‘adjuncts’ as they were called. I would now be the overseer of this domain, and I trusted the developers and architect Roger Gordon’s seamless, precise, fluent, glitch

Rewrite the text using the following feedback:
* I don't understand what a domain citizenship is, isn't that like a tourist visa?
* Why would the narrator have a 48 hour stay if he's going to be 'overlord of this new domain'?
* Along similar lines, why would he be talked to casually by a fellow colonist if he's important?
* Overall this text seems like it's going in multiple directions, pick the direction where this person is coming from earth to manage a Mars colony.
* Take the idea of Megascale and make it less schizophrenic, describe it as a coherent society<|end|>The Mars colony was vast, a valley of geodesic domes and sleek robotics crisscrossing across the red savannah. I stared out the window of my shuttle in awe at what I was seeing. As part of my agreement to lead the Megascale colony I had spent hours and hours in VR simulations. Experts had rendered them in minute detail based on economic and social information collected from the Megascale settler feeds. The truth is that none of it had prepared me for this. Megascale had been rendered up close and on the ground, or as an abstract atlas during tabletop wargames. Up here from a birds eye view the whole thing was revealed in its sheer scale, astonishing in its breadth.

They called it 'Megascale' because that was what it felt like to be inside it. 800 kilometers across, it was home to urban settlements inside biosphere quarters, dome farms, research labs, and mining facilities. People from earth might think they were mining metals, but on mars it was just as important to mine water. It had to be collected from underground ice caves where it wasn't wicked away by the lack of atmosphere. I made mental note of the three separate 'domains', equivalent to something like U.S. states, aptly named Americas, Oceania and Africa.

In the last few months tensions between these domains had grown, which could spell doom for the entire Megascale project. Mars colonies have a lot less room for conflict than countries on earth. Every system is so fragile that the baseline trust has to be high, it is a matter of basic survival that everyone in Megascale trusts their neighbors and government. Scaling this to 2 million colonists would have been an impossible task just a few decades ago, but fundamental sociological advances combined with high bandwidth mind reading devices just barely made it possible.</s>To illustrate the concept of start with value, I want you to imagine an online bulletin board. No no, not a bulletin board, the bulletin board. You know the one I mean, it uses the same damn VBulletin layout as every other online bulletin board and you’ve seen it a thousand times. You’re sick of seeing The Bulletin Board, but it doesn’t go away. The bulletin board keeps asking you to sign up, this is the dozenth time you’ve signed up for The Bulletin Board and you just want to puke thinking about it. Every so often you see someone create a new instance of The Bulletin Board and desire to throttle them, they title the boards things like ‘Rational Discussions’ and you facepalm into the vomit dripping from your mouth.

Rewrite the text using the following feedback:
* This is way too aggressive in its emotion for something as trivial as a bulletin board. It comes across juvenile.
* The VBulletin example is no longer really relevant, I'm not sure anybody uses VBulletin anymore. Maybe something more in contemporary use like WordPress?
* "desire to throttle them" is unacceptably violent language over something like a bulletin board, no well adjusted person can relate to this<|end|>When I say to start with value, I mean that you can't just put up a WordPress site and expect to get signups to your forum. There are a lot of WordPress sites out there. No like, a *lot* of WordPress sites, the default templates are all overused and if you can tell it's a WordPress site that doesn't inspire confidence that the users time spent signing up will be respected. You're expecting them to put in some effort so you should put in some effort. The first thing you need to do is signal that you're not just another low effort blog, and then you need to write great content. People are much more inclined to spend the time to sign up if you seed your forum from a preexisting audience with great content than if you try to create it from nothing.</s>Then, given these models pointing towards terminal reward (which we can update because they are ultimately themselves dense instrumental policies, so long as they *continue to point towards the same target* they can be updated in a way that makes them better models without breaking the agent) we can start to grade sensory embeddings (i.e. sequences of English text for a language model). If a embedding has a high score in this ensemble during a self-play episode we can infer instrumentals backwards from it as the latent program (or plan) implied by the sequence of discrete embeddings encoded from the sequence of tokens leading up to the reward. You average over these embeddings and the reward vector (each terminal model is a dimension of reward) in your retrieval store to get the prior over plans. Then to get chronology you have the decoder z-order the embeddings retrieved on each iterative step to turn similarity retrieval into timestep retrieval. The chronology and reward modality give you strict ordering over world states, and the embeddings of sensory input give you the semantics associated with these values. In the extremely unlikely case where chronology + reward scale imply equally valuable actions, you can tie break by flipping a coin.

Rewrite the text using the following feedback:
* The parentheticals are distracting, information in parenthesis should have just been in the main text smoothly to begin with
* This text is failing to communicate the primary, overarching point: You can learn the process and the outcome during RL training by inferring instrumental value embeddings backwards from terminally valued reward states
* So much jargon, can't we make this a little easier to read?<|end|>With these models pointing towards terminal reward we can avoid perverse instantiation by learning both the process and the outcome. The process is learned by inferring instrumental rewards over the text spans/sensory inputs that led to the reward state. The vector of real-valued rewards from our terminal reward ensemble can then be 'spread out' over the sensory spans that led up to the rewarded state based on their sequential distance from the reward. So if we have 8 spans that led to reward, the first span would get 1/8(?) the reward of the final span. Then when we want to replay these embeddings with retrieval augmented generation we order them using the decoder as an estimate of which goes in which order through their log odds. The chronology and reward modality give you strict ordering over world states, and the embeddings of sensory input give you the semantics associated with these values. In the extremely unlikely case where chronology + reward scale imply equally valuable actions, you can tie break by flipping a coin.</s>
